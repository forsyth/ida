This is a Go version of an IDA implementation I did in Limbo for Inferno,
without significant change, mainly adding some tests.
That IDA software was originally based on a C++ version included with
MIT's sfsnet software, hence their copyrights remain.
sfsnet included implementations of Chord, another protocol
I was interested in at the time, which is how I came across sfsnet.
(MIT's sfsnet should not be confused with the current
SfSNet learning network software on github.)
When I did the 2006 Limbo version, I worked through and revised the code
with reference to Rabin's paper. Converting the Limbo code to Go,
the main additions were tests and error-handling.

There are newer IDA algorithms that I might implement in due course,
but still, this is simple and effective if the files aren't vast.
